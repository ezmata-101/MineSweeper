# MineSweeper

Why will someone want to play MineSweeper, let alone in a command-line interface?

If you still want to, go read the code, find out how to play, compile the file yourself and do whatever you want or wish.  

Or, you can, however, watch someone else playing 'CLI MineSweeper': https://youtu.be/T0cdPG4RUqc
